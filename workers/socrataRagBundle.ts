Any parameter usage serves to filter (or sort) this set of data - i.e. no parameters allow you to see more data than a search without parameters. This is important to know when considering parameters that let you search for assets not found in the public catalog. If you are unauthorized to see such things, your results will be empty. Multiple repetitive parameters are treated differently from multiple unique parameters. Unique parameters, for example ?tags=fire&provenance=official filters to the intersection of the values. In this example, the search is for official assets with the tag 'fire'. Repetitive parameters filter to the union of values. For example ?tags=fire&tags=commission searches for assets tagged as either 'fire' or 'commission'. The combination of both repetitive and unique parameters follow the same rules. Thus the query ?tags=fire&tags=commission&provenance=official would search for official assets tagged as either 'fire' or 'commission'. Many parameters support repetitive usage, using either the syntax above or the alternate syntax using brackets, e.g. ?tags[]=fire&tags[]=commission. Parameter descriptions will tell whether this is supported or not. Because this API supports custom metadata search and because custom metadata keys are arbitrary, any unrecognized params are assumed to be custom metadata. Thus, if you misname a parameter, for example ?domain=data.ny.gov (the parameter should be 'domains'), the results will be empty unless there are assets with the custom metadata key 'domain' and value 'data.ny.gov'.\", \"tags\": [\"section\"], \"source_file\": \"docs/Discovery_API.md\", \"doc_id\": \"socrata_discovery\"}\n{\"id\": \"endpoint-get-catalog-v1-ids-4x4-find-assets-by-id-summary-1\", \"type\": \"endpoint\", \"title\": \"Find assets by id\", \"path\": [\"Discovery API 1.0\", \"Find assets by id\"], \"text\": \"Find assets by id\\nGET /catalog/v1?ids={4x4}\\nMost assets are uniquely identified by a string known as a four-by-four.

Draft IDs join the four-by-four of the published version with a colon and a draft identifier. For stories, which only ever support a single shared draft, the draft's identifier is \\\"draft\\\". For example, if a draft of story ku42-jx2v is created, its ID would be ku42-jx2v:draft. For non-story drafts, the draft's identifier is an integer.

If min_should_match is not specified, the service's default is '3<60%', meaning that if there are 3 or fewer search terms specified, all of them must match; otherwise 60% of the search terms must be found in the fields specified above. For example, if min_should_match is '3<60%', searching for\\n'city dog park' will require stemmed matches for all three words; thus, 'Western Cities Association Dog Parks' will match, but 'New York City Parks' will not.

Specifically, if the sum of the offset and limit parameters is greater than 10000, the server will respond with a 400. This will happen regardless of the actual result set size. Larger result sets can be incrementally paged over via the scroll_id parameter.\\nThis parameter takes a value corresponding to an asset ID, specifically, the ID of the last result in the previously fetched chunk of results. So for example, suppose you execute a query and find that it returns a large set of results (ie. more than 10000). You should execute the same query again, including a reasonable value for the limit parameter, being sure to include the scroll_id parameter as well. Initially, you won't have a value for the scroll_id parameter, so you will leave it blank.

The \\u201cendpoint\\u201d of a SODA API is simply a unique URL that represents an object or collection of objects. Every Socrata dataset, and even every individual data record, has its own endpoint. The endpoint is what you\\u2019ll point your HTTP client at to interact with data resources. All resources are accessed through a common endpoint of /api/v3/views/IDENTIFIER/query.json along with their dataset identifier. This paradigm holds true for every dataset in every SODA API. All datasets have a unique identifier - eight alphanumeric characters split into two four-character phrases by a dash. For example, ydr8-5enu is the identifier for the Building Permits. This identifier can then be inserted into the /api/v3/views/IDENTIFIER/query endpoint to construct the API endpoint. The TryIt macro has been disabled until future notice while we upgrade this site to SODA3. Once you\\u2019ve got your API endpoint, you can make requests with SoQL to filter and manipulate your dataset. Locating the API endpoint for a dataset You can also find API endpoints, and links to detailed developer documentation for each dataset, in a number of different places, depending on where you are: If you\\u2019re viewing a dataset listing within the Open Data Network, there will be a prominent \\u201cAPI\\u201d button that will take you directly to the API documentation for that dataset.  See this If you\\u2019re viewing a dataset directly, there will be an \\u201cAPI Documentation\\u201d button under \\u201cExport\\u201d and then \\u201cSODA API\\u201d.

We can do so in several different ways: By introducing new SoQL functions that provide new functionality. We could, for example, add a new function that allows you to filter or aggregate a dataset in a new way. By adding new datatypes to represent new data, like a new datatype for a new class of geospatial data. This allows us to introduce additional capabilities while still allowing you to issue the same kinds of queries in a backwards-compatible manner. We can extend SODA APIs without needing all developers to migrate their code to a new version. However, some functionalities are not available on all of our API endpoints, which is why we differentiate between versions of a dataset\\u2019s API. Functions made available on a newer version might not be available on an API endpoint of an older version. In the sidebar of our automatic API documentation, we list the version that that endpoint complies with, as well as other useful information.

Notable changes: Query requests must be either authenticated by a user or marked with a valid application token. We have separated the endpoint into two: /query for querying (e.g., https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/v3/views/ydr8-5enu/query.json) Query primarily supports machine-readability and has more options for customizing the request. /export for exports (e.g., https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/v3/views/ydr8-5enu/export.csv) Export supports more formats and focuses on generating something readable by humans.

Socrata datasets are essentially a collection of rows. Each row can be uniquely designated by its \\u201crow identifier\\u201d, much like a driver\\u2019s license number or social security number identifies an individual. For those familiar with database concepts, they essentially act the same way as primary keys. Internal Identifiers vs Publisher-Specified Identifiers Row identifiers come in two flavors: Internal identifiers are auto-generated by the Socrata platform every time a new row is created. Publisher-specified identifiers are configured by the dataset owner and use a field of unique values within the dataset as the row identifier. Depending on what dataset you're accessing, internal row identifiers may be simple integers, or alphanumeric strings. There's no difference between the two in how you use them. To learn more about how to access internal row identifiers, read the System Fields documentation. Establishing a Publisher-Specified Identifier Setting a row identifier requires that you are either the owner of a dataset, or that you've been granted a role of Publisher or Administrator on a Socrata customer site. Basically, if you can't modify the dataset, you can't set a row identifier. A publisher-specified row identifier can be established for any Socrata dataset. A common column to use as a row identifier is an \\u2018ID\\u2019 column with some kind of number or code that uniquely identifies that row of data. For example, the \\u2018Inspection ID\\u2019 column of Chicago\\u2019s Food Inspections dataset is a Publisher-specified row identifier. How to Set a Row Identifier See this helpful guide on how to set a row identifier in Socrata. RESTful Verbs The Socrata API follows the REST (REpresentational State Transfer) design pattern. This means that the CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations are specified by using HTTP methods. These are referred to as RESTful verbs. GET Use the HTTP GET method to obtain data. As described in the Endpoints section, GET can be used to retrieve column data from multiple rows or from one single row. The Queries section describes how to do sophisticated queries, all with the GET method. For SODA3, you must authenticate or use an application token in order to query for or export data. You may preferentially use POST, which is useful if your SoQL query is very long. POST Use the HTTP POST method to add new rows in a dataset. See the SODA Producer API section for more details on how to add data. Note that you will need to authenticate in order to make changes. See the Authentication section for more information on how to do this. PUT Use the HTTP PUT method to modify data. Like POST, you will need authentication. Again, see the SODA Producer API and Authentication sections for more information. DELETE Use the HTTP DELETE method to remove data. Like POST and PUT, you will need authentication.

As such, requests that aren\\u2019t using an application token come from a shared pool via IP address. IP addresses that make too many requests during a given period may be subject to throttling. When requests are made using an application token, we can actually attribute each request to a particular application and developer, granting each their own pool of API requests. Currently we do not throttle API requests that are using an application token, unless those requests are determined to be abusive or malicious. We reserve the right to change these throttling limits with notice, and we will post an update to announce any such change. If you are throttled for any reason, you will receive a status code 429 response. Don\\u2019t be a jerk! Dont do that! Yes, I know it says you get unlimited requests. But keep in mind that you\\u2019re using a shared platform, and you should still be deliberate in how you design your application to use our API. Applications that are determined to be abusive or malicious, or that otherwise monopolize the use of our API may be throttled. If we detect that your application is nearing the point where we may have to throttle it, we will likely pro-actively reach out to you to discuss how you can optimize your usage. If you have any questions, feel free to contact us and we\\u2019d be glad to help! Obtaining an Application Token You can obtain an application token by registering for one in your Socrata profile. Using your Application Token While it is possible to perform simple unauthenticated queries against the Socrata Open Data API without making use of an application token, you\\u2019ll receive much higher throttling limits if you include an application token in your requests. If you elect not to use an application token, you\\u2019ll be subjected to a much lower throttling limit for all requests originating from your IP address. Here\\u2019s how you include the application token in the request: SODA Version\\tMethod 3.0, 2.x\\tUse the X-App-Token HTTP header. 2.1, 2.0\\tUse the $$app_token parameter in your request. 1.0\\tUse the app_token parameter in your request. Using the header is the preferred method. Note: Application tokens are not necessarily used for authentication, but you should still preserve the security of your application token by always using HTTPS requests. If your application token is duplicated by another developer, their requests will count against your quota. The following is an example of using the X-App-Token HTTP header to pass an application token: POST /api/v3/views/kzjm-xkqj/query.json HTTP/1.1 Host: data.seattle.gov Accept: application/json X-App-Token: [REDACTED] The same application token could also be passed as a URL parameter: The TryIt macro has been disabled until future notice while we upgrade this site to SODA3.

For non-interactive applications, we only support HTTP Basic Authentication. We encourage all our developers of interactive applications to use the OAuth 2.0 workflow to authenticate their users. HTTP Basic Authentication is required when you are authenticating from a script that runs without interaction with the user, like your ETL tool, an update script, or any other data management automation. OAuth 2.0 is the preferred option for cases where you are building a web or mobile application that needs to perform actions on behalf of the user, like accessing data, and the interaction model allows you to present the user with a form to obtain their permission for the app to do so. Authenticating using HTTP Basic Authentication Requests can be authenticated using HTTP Basic Authentication. You can use your HTTP library\\u2019s Basic Auth feature to pass your credentials. All HTTP-basic-authenticated requests must be performed over a secure (https) connection. Authenticated requests made over an insecure connection will be denied. Users may use their username and password or an API key and secret pair to authenticate using Basic Authentication. Documentation on how to create and manage API keys can be found here. We recommend using API keys! They provide the following benefits: Access Socrata APIs without the risk of embedding your username and password in scripts or code Users on domains that require SSO (and thus without passwords) can access Socrata APIs Create individual keys for different apps or jobs so that if any one needs to be revoked or rotated, other apps are unaffected Change your account password without disrupting apps or rotate API keys without disrupting logins Here is a sample HTTP session that uses HTTP Basic Authentication: POST /api/v3/views/4tka-6guv/query.json HTTP/1.1 Host: soda.demo.socrata.com Authorization: Basic [REDACTED] Content-Type: application/json X-App-Token: [REDACTED] Note that the Authorization header in this request will usually be generated via your HTTP library\\u2019s Basic Auth feature (as opposed to manually constructing the Base64 encoding of your credentials yourself). For example, if you\\u2019re using Python\\u2019s requests module, it supports Basic Authentication out of the box. Similarly, an API tool like Postman also handles Basic Authentication. OAuth 2.0 Note: When developing applications that make use of OAuth, you must provide a web-accessible callback URL when registering your application token. This can make it difficult to develop on a machine that isn't directly exposed to the Internet. One great option is to use a tool like ngrok to create a secure tunnel to expose your web application in a secure manner.\", \"tags\": [\"section\"], \"source_file\": \"docs/Discovery_API_2.txt\", \"doc_id\": \"socrata_soda_api\"}\n{\"id\": \"section-workflow-1\", \"type\": \"section\", \"title\": \"Workflow\", \"path\": [\"API Endpoints\", \"Workflow\"], \"text\": \"Workflow\", \"tags\": [\"section\"], \"source_file\": \"docs/Discovery_API_2.txt\", \"doc_id\": \"socrata_soda_api\"}\n{\"id\": \"section-workflow-2\", \"type\": \"section\", \"title\": \"Workflow\", \"path\": [\"API Endpoints\", \"Workflow\"], \"text\": \"We support a subset of OAuth 2.0 \\u2014 the server-based flow with a callback URL \\u2014 which we believe is more secure than the other flows in the specification. This OAuth flow is used by several other popular API services on the web. We have made the authentication flow similar to Google AuthSub. To authenticate with OAuth 2.0, you will first need to register your application, which will create an app token and a secret token. When registering your application, you must preregister your server by filling out the Callback Prefix field), so that we can be sure that access through your application is secure even if both your tokens are stolen. The Callback Prefix is the beginning of the URL that you will use as your redirect URL. Generally, you\\u2019ll want to provide as much of your callback URL as you can. For example, if your authentication callback is https://my-website.com/socrata-app/auth/callback, you might want to specify https://my-website.com/socrata-app as your callback URL. Once you have an application and a secret token, you\\u2019ll be able to authenticate with the SODA OAuth 2.0 endpoint. You\\u2019ll first need to redirect the user to the Socrata-powered site you wish to access so that they may log in and approve your application. For example: https://soda.demo.socrata.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN&response_type=code &redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI Note that the redirect_uri here must be an absolute, secure (https:) URI which starts with the Callback Prefix you specified when you registered your application. If any of these cases fail, the user will be shown an error indicating as much. Should the user authorize your application, they will be redirected back to the your redirect_uri. For example, if I provide https://my-website.com/socrata-app/auth/callback as my redirect_uri, the user will be redirected to this URL: https://my-website.com/socrata-app/auth/callback?code=CODE where CODE is an authorization code that you will use later. If your redirect_uri contains a querystring, it will be preserved, and the code parameter will be added onto the end of it. Likewise, if you provide the optional state parameter in the original redirect to /authenticate, it will be preserved and sent back to you. Now that the user has authorized your application, the next step is to retrieve an access_token so that you can perform operations on their behalf. You can do this by making the following POST request from your server: https://soda.demo.socrata.com/oauth/access_token \\\"client_id\\\": YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN, \\\"client_secret\\\": YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN, \\\"grant_type\\\": \\\"authorization_code\\\", \\\"redirect_uri\\\": YOUR_REDIRECT_URI, \\\"code\\\": CODE where YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN and YOUR_SECRET_TOKEN are the tokens you received when registering your app, YOUR_REDIRECT_URI is the same value as what you used previously, and CODE is the value of the code query parameter of the URL that the user was redirected to. You\\u2019ll receive the following response: { access_token: ACCESS_TOKEN } Use this access_token in your requests when you have to do work on behalf of the now-authenticated user, as described below in the Using an OAuth 2.0 Access Token section. We have a sample app available on GitHub that illustrates how to do all of the above with the Ruby OAuth2 gem. Using an OAuth 2.0 Access Token Once you have obtained an access_token, you should include it on requests which need to happen on behalf of the user. The token must be included in the Authorization HTTP Header field as follows: Authorization: OAuth YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN Note: All authenticated requests must be performed over a secure connection (https). Any attempt to use an access_token over a non-secure connection will result in immediate revocation of the token. Who am I? One quirk of authenticating via OAuth 2.0 is that the entire process happens without the 3rd party application (that\\u2019s you!) having any knowledge of who, exactly, the user is that just authorized the application.

A note on how datasets are updated Data providers use many different methods to update datasets. In some cases, they use tools like DataSync or the SODA Producer API to update datasets, and we can tell which records within the dataset have actually been modified, and only update them accordingly. When data providers perform a full replace of the dataset using the SODA Producer Replace API, all of its records will be updated within a short period of time, in which case a query based on :updated_at will show that all of the records have changed.\", \"tags\": [\"section\"], \"source_file\": \"docs/Discovery_API_2.txt\", \"doc_id\": \"socrata_soda_api\"}\n{\"id\": \"section-version-2-0-1\", \"type\": \"section\", \"title\": \"Version 2.0\", \"path\": [\"API Endpoints\", \"Version 2.0\"], \"text\": \"Version 2.0\", \"tags\": [\"section\"], \"source_file\": \"docs/Discovery_API_2.txt\", \"doc_id\": \"socrata_soda_api\"}\n{\"id\": \"section-version-2-0-2\", \"type\": \"section\", \"title\": \"Version 2.0\", \"path\": [\"API Endpoints\", \"Version 2.0\"], \"text\": \"Getting the SODA API to return system fields is as simple as adding the parameter $$exclude_system_fields=false to your request.

CORS & JSONP For security reasons, web browsers prevent what are called \\u201ccross-origin\\u201d or \\u201ccross-site\\u201d requests from one domain to another. JavaScript XMLHTTPRequests (commonly called \\u201cAJAX\\u201d requests) inherit all of the authentication context of the currently logged in user, so a malicious web page could attempt to make malicious requests that cross domain contexts and cause trouble. Historically, that has made it difficult for web developers to build web applications making use of third-party APIs. Fortunately, techniques have since been developed that allow developers to securely access APIs cross-domain. The two most popular ones, and the techniques that Socrata supports, are CORS and JSONP. A note on CORS, JSONP, and dataset permissions In order to prevent the aforementioned malicious cross-site attacks, Socrata automatically drops all authentication and authorization on requests that come in via CORS and JSONP. As a result, these techniques can only be used to access public datasets in a read-only fashion. Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) CORS is a proposed standard for allowing your web browser and a web server to negotiate and allow requests to be made across domain contexts. CORS is currently supported in modern Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Internet Explorer (10+) web browsers. The standard itself is working its way through the W3C on its way to becoming official. You don\\u2019t need to do anything special to use CORS with JavaScript in a modern browser. Your web browser and our servers will automatically negotiate the cross-origin request. For example, to make a CORS request with jQuery, you\\u2019d make your request just like you were performing it within the context of your own domain. $.ajax({ url: \\\"https://data.chattlibrary.org/api/v3/views/e968-fnk9/query.json\\\", method: \\\"POST\\\", dataType: \\\"json\\\", data: JSON.stringify({ \\\"query\\\": \\\"SELECT * WHERE status = 'CLOSED'\\\", \\\"page\\\": { \\\"pageNumber\\\": 1, \\\"pageSize\\\": 1000\", \"tags\": [\"section\"], \"source_file\": \"docs/Discovery_API_2.txt\", \"doc_id\": \"socrata_soda_api\"}\n{\"id\": \"section-section-1\", \"type\": \"section\", \"title\": \"},\", \"path\": [\"API Endpoints\", \"},\"], \"text\": \"},\\n\\\"includeSynthetic\\\": false\", \"tags\": [\"section\"], \"source_file\": \"docs/Discovery_API_2.txt\", \"doc_id\": \"socrata_soda_api\"}\n{\"id\": \"section-section-1\", \"type\": \"section\", \"title\": \"}),\", \"path\": [\"API Endpoints\", \"}),\"], \"text\": \"}),\\nheaders: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', 'X-App-Token': app_token\", \"tags\": [\"section\"], \"source_file\": \"docs/Discovery_API_2.txt\", \"doc_id\": \"socrata_soda_api\"}\n{\"id\": \"section-section-1\", \"type\": \"section\", \"title\": \"},\", \"path\": [\"API Endpoints\", \"},\"], \"text\": \"},\\nsuccess: function( data, status, jqxhr ){ console.log( \\\"Request received:\\\", data ); error: function( jqxhr, status, error ){ console.log( \\\"Something went wrong!\\\" );\", \"tags\": [\"section\"], \"source_file\": \"docs/Discovery_API_2.txt\", \"doc_id\": \"socrata_soda_api\"}\n{\"id\": \"section-section-1\", \"type\": \"section\", \"title\": \"});\", \"path\": [\"API Endpoints\", \"});\"], \"text\": \"});\", \"tags\": [\"section\"], \"source_file\": \"docs/Discovery_API_2.txt\", \"doc_id\": \"socrata_soda_api\"}\n{\"id\": \"section-section-2\", \"type\": \"section\", \"title\": \"});\", \"path\": [\"API Endpoints\", \"});\"], \"text\": \"\\u201cJavaScript with Padding\\u201d (JSONP) If you\\u2019re developing for older browsers, or you just feel like being nostalgic, you can also make use of our support for JSONP. Also called \\u201cJSON with Padding\\u201d, it is a technique for fooling a web browser into performing cross-origin requests using a special <script> tag that uses the src attribute to make a special API request. Instead of responding with just a JSON object, the server responds with JavaScript code that calls a client-declared callback function, passing the data as that function\\u2019s first parameter. With the Socrata API, the name of that callback function is declared using the $jsonp parameter. Sounds hacky, huh? Fortunately, tools like jQuery make it easy to use JSONP: $.ajax({ url: \\\"https://data.chattlibrary.org/resource/e968-fnk9.json\\\", jsonp: \\\"$jsonp\\\", dataType: \\\"jsonp\\\" }).done(function(data) { console.log(\\\"Request received: \\\" + data); But, as we mentioned, you should only need to use JSONP as a fallback in cases where you\\u2019re working with a browser that doesn\\u2019t support CORS. Queries using SODA3 The Socrata APIs provide rich query functionality through a query language we call the \\u201cSocrata Query Language\\u201d or \\u201cSoQL\\u201d. As its name might suggest, it borrows heavily from Structured Query Language (SQL), used by many relational database systems. Its paradigms should be familiar to most developers who have previously worked with SQL, and are easy to learn for those who are new to it. Requests must be either authenticated by a user or marked with a valid application token. Developers should now use the HTTP POST method when requesting queries, as this allows for longer queries and clearer options. The endpoints are split into two: /query for querying (e.g., https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/v3/views/ydr8-5enu/query.json) Query has more options for customizing the request so that you can fine-tune what data you want back. /export for exports (e.g., https://data.cityofchicago.org/api/v3/views/ydr8-5enu/export.csv) Export focuses on providing the entire dataset to be consumed by humans or Microsoft Excel or similar programs.

This allows you to set the response format without requiring the ability to set headers in your HTTP client. Simply add the extension to the endpoint. For example, if your resource endpoint is /resource/644b-gaut, and you wanted to get CSV output, your path would be /resource/644b-gaut.csv. HTTP Accept Headers HTTP Accept headers allow applications to automatically negotiate content types with a web service. With SODA, this also means you can request content types using Accept headers without needing to provide a response type extension. Simply send an Accept header along with the desired mimetype for the desired response type. For example, to request JSON, you\\u2019d use a header of Accept: application/json.
