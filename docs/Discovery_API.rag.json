        "Our data platform hosts tens of thousands of government assets. Governments large and small publish data on crime, permits, finance, healthcare, research, performance, and more for citizens to use. While this large corpus of government data is already accessible via opendatanetwork.com, this API opens up this corpus of government data for automated searching, research, and exploration. Assets can be found by keywords, high-level categorizations, tags, and much more. This API is a powerful way to access and explore data on our platform. The production API endpoints for this API are at https://api.us.socrata.com/api/catalog/v1 for domains in North America https://api.eu.socrata.com/api/catalog/v1 for all other domains For example, to query for datasets categorized as 'Public Safety', you could use the following query: http://api.us.socrata.com/api/catalog/v1?categories=public%20safety"

These factors are: the asset's audience - as public vs internal or private the asset's publication status - as published vs unpublished in a draft state the approval status of the asset - as approved vs pending or rejected whether the asset is hidden - as false i.e. not hidden vs true i.e. hidden"

To authenticate, you must: Use one of the methods discussed here and Provide the 'X-Socrata-Host' host header with the domain that has granted you access to view its assets. For example 'X-Socrata-Host:data.ny.gov'. When properly authenticated, you will be able to search over: All data that is anonymously-viewable. Any data that you own or that has been shared to you.

        "Search without any parameters returns the set of data you are authorized to see. Any parameter usage serves to filter (or sort) this set of data - i.e. no parameters allow you to see more data than a search without parameters. This is important to know when considering parameters that let you search for assets not found in the public catalog. If you are unauthorized to see such things, your results will be empty. Multiple repetitive parameters are treated differently from multiple unique parameters. Unique parameters, for example ?tags=fire&provenance=official filters to the intersection of the values. In this example, the search is for official assets with the tag 'fire'. Repetitive parameters filter to the union of values. For example ?tags=fire&tags=commission searches for assets tagged as either 'fire' or 'commission'. The combination of both repetitive and unique parameters follow the same rules. Thus the query ?tags=fire&tags=commission&provenance=official would search for official assets tagged as either 'fire' or 'commission'. Many parameters support repetitive usage, using either the syntax above or the alternate syntax using brackets, e.g. ?tags[]=fire&tags[]=commission. Parameter descriptions will tell whether this is supported or not. Because this API supports custom metadata search and because custom metadata keys are arbitrary, any unrecognized params are assumed to be custom metadata. Thus, if you misname a parameter, for example ?domain=data.ny.gov (the parameter should be 'domains'), the results will be empty unless there are assets with the custom metadata key 'domain' and value 'data.ny.gov'."

      "text": "Search without any parameters returns the set of data you are authorized to see. Any parameter usage serves to filter (or sort) this set of data - i.e. no parameters allow you to see more data than a search without parameters. This is important to know when considering parameters that let you search for assets not found in the public catalog. If you are unauthorized to see such things, your results will be empty. Multiple repetitive parameters are treated differently from multiple unique parameters. Unique parameters, for example ?tags=fire&provenance=official filters to the intersection of the values. In this example, the search is for official assets with the tag 'fire'. Repetitive parameters filter to the union of values. For example ?tags=fire&tags=commission searches for assets tagged as either 'fire' or 'commission'. The combination of both repetitive and unique parameters follow the same rules. Thus the query ?tags=fire&tags=commission&provenance=official would search for official assets tagged as either 'fire' or 'commission'. Many parameters support repetitive usage, using either the syntax above or the alternate syntax using brackets, e.g. ?tags[]=fire&tags[]=commission. Parameter descriptions will tell whether this is supported or not. Because this API supports custom metadata search and because custom metadata keys are arbitrary, any unrecognized params are assumed to be custom metadata. Thus, if you misname a parameter, for example ?domain=data.ny.gov (the parameter should be 'domains'), the results will be empty unless there are assets with the custom metadata key 'domain' and value 'data.ny.gov'.",

This is a string made from eight alphanumeric characters split into two four-character phrases, e.g. ku42-jx2v. While most assets follow this pattern, their drafts do not. Draft IDs join the four-by-four of the published version with a colon and a draft identifier. For stories, which only ever support a single shared draft, the draft's identifier is \"draft\". For example, if a draft of story ku42-jx2v is created, its ID would be ku42-jx2v:draft. For non-story drafts, the draft's identifier is an integer. For example, if the 7th draft of asset cio5-yr56 is created, its ID would be cio5-yr56:7. The ids parameter will limit the results to the assets identified in this way.\nExamples:\n?ids=ku42-jx2v\n?ids=ku42-jx2v&ids=ku42-jx2v:draft\n?ids=cio5-yr56,cio5-yr56:7",

For example one domain might have a set named 'Dataset Information' which has keys 'Localities' and 'Agencies & Authorities', while another domain has a set named 'Dataset Category' having key 'Agency').

The q parameter takes arbitrary text and will limit the results to those having some or all of the text. The optional min_should_match parameter may be used to explicitly specify the number or percent of words that must match. See the Elasticsearch docs for the format of arguments to min_should_match. If min_should_match is not specified, the service's default is '3<60%', meaning that if there are 3 or fewer search terms specified, all of them must match; otherwise 60% of the search terms must be found in the fields specified above. For example, if min_should_match is '3<60%', searching for\n'city dog park' will require stemmed matches for all three words; thus, 'Western Cities Association Dog Parks' will match, but 'New York City Parks' will not. 'trees green spaces new york' will require 60% of the words to match, which is 3 out of 5 words. Thus, 'New York Tree Map', and 'New Green Spaces Initiative' will both match.\nExamples:\n?q=result\n?q=school%20result%20SAT\n?q=school%20result%20SAT&min_should_match=-1",

As a result, the search service does not support paging over a large set of search results. Specifically, if the sum of the offset and limit parameters is greater than 10000, the server will respond with a 400. This will happen regardless of the actual result set size. Larger result sets can be incrementally paged over via the scroll_id parameter.\nThis parameter takes a value corresponding to an asset ID, specifically, the ID of the last result in the previously fetched chunk of results. So for example, suppose you execute a query and find that it returns a large set of results (ie. more than 10000). You should execute the same query again, including a reasonable value for the limit parameter, being sure to include the scroll_id parameter as well. Initially, you won't have a value for the scroll_id parameter, so you will leave it blank.

Using the autocomplete endpoint for asset names returns assets having titles that match the search query. Any of the filtering parameters described above may be used with the required q parameter. Note that while this endpoint mirrors the top-level search endpoint, the behavior of the q parameter differs slightly. Just as with the full search endpoint, it takes arbitrary text. However, the autocomplete search is restricted to the 'name' field of the asset (i.e. the asset title). Additionally, this autocomplete search can return different assets than the top-level search. An simplified explanation is that the former matches characters while the latter matches words.\nAn additional and optional parameter, deduplicate, provides two different behaviors. If 'true', no asset title will appear more than once. If 'false', every matching asset is returned along with its four-by-four identifier.\nExamples:\n?q=medi\n?q=medi&deduplicate=true\n?q=medi&deduplicate=false",
