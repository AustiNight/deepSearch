  - [ ] Expand method discovery to include tactic-driven query variations and track method provenance by vertical/subtopic
  - [ ] Implement per-vertical query packs (e.g., Individual -> Professional/Assets/News/Social) and ensure they are executed before declaring completeness
  - [ ] Validate that person/address topics generate targeted tactics (LinkedIn, public records, property assessment, tax collector) in spawned queries (acceptance criteria)

- [ ] Epic: Add probabilistic exhaustion heuristics and multi-round loop control
  - [ ] Define exhaustion metrics: unique domain growth per round, new sources per round, query novelty ratio, diminishing returns score
  - [ ] Implement multi-round search loop with configurable max rounds and early stop thresholds (not "checking against reality")
  - [ ] Add per-vertical exhaustion criteria (e.g., Individual: keep searching until Employment found OR 5 name variants exhausted)
  - [ ] Keep `forceExhaustion` override while replacing `critique.isExhaustive` gating with computed exhaustion score
  - [ ] Validate that low-coverage topics trigger extra rounds and that exhaustion stops only after thresholds are met (acceptance criteria)

- [ ] Epic: Update prompts, types, and UI telemetry
  - [ ] Extend `types.ts` for taxonomy/blueprint models (ResearchVertical, ResearchSubtopic, ResearchTactic, BlueprintField, ExhaustionMetrics)
  - [ ] Update OpenAI/Gemini prompts to accept taxonomy/blueprint context in sector analysis, critique, and method extraction
  - [ ] Update agent naming to reflect assigned vertical + subtopic + tactic pack in `hooks/useOverseer.ts` so UI nodes display intent, not generic labels
  - [ ] Update `components/AgentGraph.tsx` (and related UI) to render the enriched agent name without truncating key vertical/tactic identifiers
  - [ ] Log vertical classification decision with confidence/weights in `hooks/useOverseer.ts`
  - [ ] Log blueprint fields selected per vertical before spawning agents
  - [ ] Log tactic pack selection per subtopic and the exact query templates used
  - [ ] Log per-round exhaustion metrics and explicit stop reason (threshold met vs max rounds vs forceExhaustion)
  - [ ] Log taxonomy growth events (agent‑proposed tactics accepted/rejected with provenance) 
  - [ ] Log hybrid branching and coverage metrics in `hooks/useOverseer.ts`
  - [ ] Define and implement a narrative Overseer log format (phase header -> decision -> action -> outcome) so UI logs read as a coherent story of the new approach
  - [ ] Ensure `SYSTEM_INSTRUCTION_OVERSEER` reflects vertical classification + exhaustion-first reasoning
  - [ ] Validate the app completes a run and displays the new telemetry logs (acceptance criteria)
